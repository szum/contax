## Contax

A contact list app built with Material UI components in React. The backend is a serverless architecture with a CI/CD pipeline provisioned by AWS Amplify. Data is served to the client via GraphQl API, and uploaded assets (photos for the contact's picture) are stored in an S3 bucket.

App is hosted on this URL for testing: https://master.dpkqn0ib0xj80.amplifyapp.com/

If you'd like to run the app locally you can pull and `yarn install` & `yarn start`
